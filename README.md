POLYGLOT
We have built a translator app that translates any text that is copied in the clipboard and shows the translated text in the form of a toast pop-up without root access. Thus the hassle of switching apps is eliminated decreasing the time requirement and increasing productivity. The app also allows you to store the results in a local file so it works as an offline dictionary as well. The app uses YANDEX API to perform the translations.

Feature (Meaning pop-up) 
1. Select and hold the word you'd like to get the definition for.
2. Click on the COPY option from the Options Menu.
